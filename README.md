The Workers Dashboard is a dynamic, high-performance web application designed for streamlined workforce management and task delegation. Built with React 19, Vite, and Tailwind CSS v4, this project serves as a comprehensive tool for administrators to manage employee lists, assign localized tasks, and monitor productivity in a modern, responsive interface.

Core Features
Employee Management: Users can manually add custom staff members or import real data from the JSONPlaceholder API.

Context-Aware Tasking: Each employee card acts as an independent workspace where tasks can be added, toggled for completion, and filtered by status (All, Completed, Uncompleted).

Persistent Storage: Integrated LocalStorage ensures that all staff data and task progress are saved locally in the browser, preventing data loss upon page refreshes.

Global Theme System: A custom React Context implementation provides a seamless Dark Mode experience, allowing users to toggle themes across the entire dashboard instantly.

Optimized UI: Features a paginated API directory, real-time search filtering, and a responsive grid layout that adapts perfectly from mobile devices to ultra-wide monitors.
